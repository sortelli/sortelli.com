I've had sortelli.com for a very long time, and have never bothered
posting anything to the website.

Instead of having nothing here, I've decided to start posting random
junk as it occurs to me to do so. I'm sure this will end up like
so many diaries and have a few posts in a row, followed by nothing
ever again.

#### Btw, what's with all the "Hello World" stuff?

It's kind of my personal motto. [Hello, world][hello-world] is the
first program everyone learns how to write in any given programming
language.

To me, hello world is a lot of things. It symbolizes the learning
of new things, and starting on a journey of discovery. It's beautiful
in its minimalism and representation, yet complex in its execution.
It's also true that the following is tattooed somewhere on my body:

{% highlight C %}
#include <stdio.h>
main() {
  printf("hello, world\n");
}
{% endhighlight %}
