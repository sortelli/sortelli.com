Around 15 years ago (in the year 2000), I wrote my first video game.
I dug up the code recently and couldn't believe how ridiculous it
is. A really crappy game implemented with some truly atrocious code.

I decided that the only reasonable thing to do with this code is
port the game to run on modern platforms. To make it fun, I'd do
the port without changing a single line of the original source code.

In addition to the [port](https://github.com/sortelli/tankbeta), I
also whipped up an [online playable
version](http://tankbeta.sortelli.com/play) of the game, and an
amusing set of [annotated source](http://tankbeta.sortelli.com/source).

## The Game

This game is similar to the tank game in [Atari
Combat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_%281977_video_game%29). Both
players play using the same keyboard, and can shoot one bullet at
a time.

### Keyboard Controls

    Command    |  Player 1  | Player 2
    -----------|------------|------------
    Forward    |  E         | UP_ARROW
    Backward   |  C         | DOWN_ARROW
    Turn Left  |  S         | LEFT_ARROW
    Turn Right |  F         | RIGHT_ARROW
    Fire       |  D         | ENTER

### Play Online!

Play the quick-and-dirty web based implementation:

## The Port

The original game was written in Borland C++, using the [Borland
Graphics Interface](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/bgi/doc/) (BGI)
as the graphics layer. I've created a shim between the BGI functions
called in the game code, and [libsdl](https://www.libsdl.org/).

The shim code also helps clean up a few minor issues to allow the
older Borland C++ code to build using a modern version of gcc.

See the [github project](https://github.com/sortelli/tankbeta) for
more information.
